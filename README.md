# PDE_Matlab_Code_solution-
As part of my thesis, I had to solve a PDE numerically. The PDE represents the displacement of a beam-like structure at the microscale for a microbotic related project. It was not particularly amenable to an analytical mathematical solution. 

The BCs were taken from relevant literature and Euler forward finite difference method was employed. The PDE reads, u_t= (beta/4)*(s^2 -1)*u_ss-(1/eta)*(u_ssss).
